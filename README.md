# Crowdsourced parking perceptions from Google Maps reviews

# Parking Sentiment Analysis across US Cities

## Overview

This project analyzes parking perceptions across the United States using crowdsourced online reviews from Google Maps. We employ natural language processing techniques and regression analysis to investigate public sentiment towards parking and its relationship with various socio-spatial factors.

## Abstract

Due to increased reliance on private vehicles and growing travel demand, parking remains a longstanding urban challenge globally. This study introduces a cost-effective and widely accessible data source, crowdsourced online reviews, to investigate public perceptions of parking across the U.S. We examine 4,987,483 parking-related reviews for 1,129,460 points of interest (POIs) across 911 core-based statistical areas (CBSAs) sourced from Google Maps.

We employ the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model to classify parking sentiment and conduct regression analyses to explore its relationships with socio-spatial factors. Our findings reveal significant variations in parking sentiment across POI types and CBSAs, with insights into the relationships between urban density, demographics, socioeconomic status, and parking experiences.
